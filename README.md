# Linux

- Linux is a Unix-like OS developed By Linus Torvalds and thousands of opensource contributors

- Linux is an operating system it is more reliable and secure than others; 

- Completely opensource

- 17 Sep 1991

- Linux is everywhere!

        - 85% of all Smartphones are based on Linux.

        - Car Uses Linux Especially self-driving cars

        - even refrigerators need Linux to run

        - Top 500 supercomputers run on Linux

## Why use Linux?
#### Windows

- GUI Based OS 

- PowerShell for scripting

- Need to Purchase a License 

- Requires antivirus software

- May Graffics cards support better for Gaming

#### Linux

- CLI Based OS and GUI options

- Bash and other shells for scripting

- License is free

- More secure than Windows

- Less developer focus on Gaming

#### Advantages

- Opensource

- Freely available

- Secure

- Lightweight Interface 

- Multi user Os

#### Disadvantages

- Harder Learning curve 

- Hardware drivers

- Limited Software availability 

- Poor support for Gaming

- Difficult to Troubleshoot

## GNU/Linux
GNU/Linux is a Unix-like Os made up of different OS components and services that create the Linux OS.

## Linux Distros

- Debian

- fedora

- Ubuntu

- Linux mint

- CentOS

- Red Hat

- SUSE 

- Kali Linux

## Basics of shell

A Shell interprets the commands we have entered send into the OS to perform them

#### Top Shells in Linux

- Bash:
    The Bourne Again Shell is the default shell in a lot of Linux distributions. It is the most portable shell available.

- zsh:
    It is similar to bash or an extended version of it. It has a lot of useful features like sharing your command history across multiple terminals

- fish:
    Friendly and Interactive shell is again an extended version of the common shell. It has great features like autocompletion of commands

- tcsh:
    Tenex C shell is an extended version of the C shell. The plus of tcshis its scripting language, because it will be similar for users with experience in C programming

#### CLI

- Linux provides an interface for users

- Interact with OS

- Bridge between human-readable commands and underlying kernel

## Basics of Kernel

a Linux Kernel is a Unix Like OS Kernel. It is a computer program witch is the core interface witch connect Hardware companies to the software processes

    The kernel is a computer program that acts as the brain and centre of os

#### Top operations performed by a Kernel

- Process Management:
    `The kernel Keeps track of all active processes running on the system and it maintains a process table that conatins information about each process`

- Memory Management:
    `The kernel handles memory allocation and protection`

- Device Management:
    `The kernel interacts with hardware devices such as disks, networks interface and peripherals it provides an interface for user-level applications to communicate with these devices`

- Input/Output(I/O) Communication:
    `The kernel facilitates communication between user-level applications and hardware'

## Linux Directory Structure

|Directories|Description|
|:-----------:|:------------------------------------------:|
|/bin|essential user binaries such as the bash shell ls, cp commands|
|/boot|contain files needed to boot the system|
|/dev| It is the location of the device files such as dev/sda1, dev/sda2, etc.|
|/etc|system configuration files such as network settings, user a/c info, etc.|
|/home|user home directory. It is the default current directory|
|/Lib|system Libraries and kernel modules|
|/media|mount points for external/removable devices such as cd, DVD and USB drives.|
|/mnt|Temporary mount points|
|/opt|optional or third-party software.|
|/proc|conatinsinfo about the running processes with a specific process ID or PID|
|/root|root user home directory ie, system admin|
|/run|it stores volatile runtime data.|
|/sbin| binary executable programs for an administrator.|
|/temp|Temporary Files|
|/srv|It contains server-specific and server-related files.|
|/usr|User related programs|
|/var|log files / variable data or files that change frequently|

## Baisc commands

nithin@nithinspc2:~$:
- username:nithin
- hostname:nithinspc2
- ~: representing home directory

### Commands
